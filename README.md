# Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for Black Hole Simulations

This repository contains the code for a research project aiming to enhance our understanding of the accretion disks surrounding black holes observed in the SgrA* and M87 galaxies through the EHT. We leverage Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to streamline expensive GRMHD simulations and generate novel predictions.

## Background

Recent observations of black holes in the center of the SgrA* and M87 galaxies by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) have provided incredible insights into these cosmic phenomena. However, refining predictions for the future and understanding the intricacies of the accretion disks around these black holes demands high computational costs using the General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) framework.

This project introduces an alternative approach, using machine learning and more specifically, Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). This novel methodology seeks to reduce computational costs while generating robust and accurate predictions.
